# FRDM-AntiTheftSystem
Sensor Safety and Anti Theft System with FRDM KL25Z Coded in Embedded C:
This is a FRDM-KL25Z based, interrupt-driven project. The system uses DHT22 for temperature and humidity measurements, a rain sensor to detect the rain, NEO7M GPS module to receive location information, and SIM800L to communicate with the user via SMS. The sent data in SMS messages are read via an Android App, based on Google's Map With Marker app, which takes the data and marks the coordinates sent by the system on Google Maps. The app on Android is coded in Java. The project is coded in Embedded C.
